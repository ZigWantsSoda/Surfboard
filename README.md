# Surfboard
Surfboard is a C Browser based on GTK 3 and WebkitGTK
# Why?
1. **There are No LightWeight Browsers anymore (i think?)**
2. **I am bored**
3. **I Need it for my Raspberry pi**
4. **Wanted to learn C so I "vibe coded" so I could have a reason**
5. **Might Turn Into a Fully Fledged Browser and make a fork called "Surfboard lite" which will take responsibliliy to be this project(that was a strech)**
And many more
